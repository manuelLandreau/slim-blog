# Slim Framework 3 Php-Di Skeleton

This is a simple Slim 3 skeleton to quickly get started building your Slim 3 applications.
For this application I have chosen a php-di/slim-bridge for dependency injection.

### Installation
```
composer create-project fritsvt/slim-skeleton
```

### Run the project
To run the slim application simply execute the command below
```
php -S localhost:8000 -t public/
```
